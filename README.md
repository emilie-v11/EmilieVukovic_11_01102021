# Kasa, OC project # 11

This is my first project in React. I only have to use Class Components (not Hooks) for this case study.

## Instructions

The Kasa website, a platform for renting accommodation between individuals (more than 500 ads posted per day), was coded more than 10 years ago in in ASP.NET with a significant legacy code.

We needed to completely overhaul the site to a full JavaScript stack with NodeJS on the back-end, and React on the front-end.
I'm in charge of creating the front-end in React from the provided mockups.
